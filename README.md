# Tamagotchi-Project

### Overview

You will play the Tamagotchi game by taking hatching, and caring for your Tamagotchi Pet through it's lifecycle.  Be careful!  If you neglect the needs of your pet it will DIE!! And you will lose the game.

### Game Play

You will begin your parenting adventure by clicking the "play game" button.  At that point your pet's egg will appear on the screen and the clock will start to count down to your pet's hatching/birth.  

When you pet hatches it will appear as a baby.  You will be responsible for: 
- feeding your pet as it's hunger level increases
- making sure your pet gets plenty of exercise as it's bordom increases.
- Making sure your pet gets enough sleep as it's sleepiness increases. 

Be Careful!  If any of your pet's hunger, bordom, or sleepiness meters fill up then your pet will DIE!! 

Your Job is to care for your pet through it's entire life cycle, and send it off into the night with care and love.
